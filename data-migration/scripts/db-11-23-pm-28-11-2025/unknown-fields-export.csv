to provide high quality education and training,

to conduct research studies and publication activities,

to share the findings with the society at local and international level,

to contribute to the accumulation of global knowledge.

Mission of AUC;

• to preserve and protect cultural heritage of  Walled City of  Nicosia

Campus

The campus of the American University of Cyprus is located within the ‘Walled City’ of Nicosia with a frequent bus service to surrounding areas.

AUC Life

The focus of AUC is to create a learning environment that encourages students to embrace the culture that surrounds us.  The university is an ever evolving institution that has grown at a rapid pace with the nucleus being centred round the qualified motivated lecturers, the friendly administrative team and ancillary staff.  The surrounding area is a mass of colour and charm enticing to the mind and challenging to the senses, with the university combining a modern and technical place of learning with the historic and cultural setting.",8095a2ffb5d8045bf7601116,study-in-kazakhstan,IBfLssGjH23-f9uxjH5Ms,reviews,05eaa661f377e5c0b9518853,unknown-field-18877fd7

Dear Sir/Madam
We are well aware of the contents of the acceptance letter, and it has now become clear why you impose such conditions. The reason is not just that your university's degree is unrecognized, but also that there is a severe lack of credibility in the administration of the university. It is evident that your primary goal is to collect money rather than to provide proper education to students.

While searching for universities for our son, we came across numerous reviews regarding fraudulent activities in Northern Cyprus universities. Unfortunately, we mistakenly believed that your university adhered to European standards. Unfortunately, it will take you hundreds of years to reach the European level in terms of professionalism and credibility. We will now do our part by spreading the negative reviews about your institution.

Let me clarify, we never intended to pay the amount and then request a refund. We regret the unprofessional experience we have had with your university.",8c14d65a33350096eb25dfea,study-in-kazakhstan,IBfLssGjH23-f9uxjH5Ms,reviews,05eaa661f377e5c0b9518853,unknown-field-ad6d9520

Attention to all new students considering Cyprus Health and Social Sciences University: Several Moroccan students, including myself and over 10 of my friends, have been victims of a disturbing scam perpetrated by this institution.

Here's what happened: Upon transferring to Cyprus Health and Social Sciences University, we were promised the opportunity to continue our studies and build a better future. However, after paying hefty fees and transferring our hard-earned credits, the university shockingly forced us to start from scratch, nullifying all our previous efforts. Despite our protests, requests for refunds were callously denied.

Now, faced with this betrayal, we are left with a difficult decision to make. We can either allow ourselves to be victims of this injustice or take action to hold the university accountable and prevent others from falling into the same trap.

As a community, we must stand together and demand justice. We have the power to raise awareness, report misconduct, and seek restitution for ourselves and future students who may be targeted by similar scams.

To all new students: Before enrolling in any institution, please heed this warning and thoroughly research its reputation and practices. Your education and future are too precious to be jeopardized by deceitful institutions.

This was followed by recognition from YODAK (Higher Education Council of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus).  These required national accreditations were followed by a number of program accreditations and international recognitions.  This year is our 33th graduation ceremony that will occur in June of 2018 when more than 1500 graduates will earn their degrees and go on to advanced studies or to excellent jobs in Europe, the region and the World.

In 1995 GAU started its expansion into the international higher education sector.  Since then educational partnerships have been developed in India, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, the USA, the UK, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong and Moldova.  These partnerships include student and faculty exchanges and the opportunity for students to experience different cultures and learning experiences.

The initial vision of the founders was to establish GAU as the pre-eminent institution of higher learning for the professions.  The university now includes degree offerings in Business and Economics, Politics, Health Sciences, Engineering, Communication, Humanities, Law, Pharmacy, Education, Architecture, Aviation, Marine, Nursing, Sports, Performing Arts and Tourism.

While heading towards the 50th year, GAU, throughout its 33 years of development the management, faculty and staff of the university have balanced the requirements for growth, with the need for high levels of quality, both in teaching and in the overall experience of each student.

Throughout its 33 year history, GAU has sought to optimize its use of the latest in technology and teaching methods.  While we have one of the highest Ph.D. to student ratios, we also have the highest computer to student ratio.  For the past five years the GAU library has been at the forefront of the revolution in library science; the implementation of digital library resources.  Many classes now include Power Point presentations and MP-4 download versions of the lectures.  The entire campus and all dormitories have Wi-Fi throughout.  GAU TV and Radio also broadcast selected lectures and seminars for student and faculty viewing.

GAU is continuing its global activities at an incredible pace today in light of its founding mission. As a member of the Universal Education Group and the American Education Consortium, GAU is moving firmly in achieving its targets while heading towards it’s 50th year in education.

Metropolitan college also don't have student support system. I struggled a lot to complete course work with ZERO Lecturer support.

We are well aware of the contents of the acceptance letter, and it has now become clear why you impose such conditions. The reason is not just that your university's degree is unrecognized, but also that there is a severe lack of credibility in the administration of the university.

This was followed by recognition from YODAK (Higher Education Council of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus).  These required national accreditations were followed by a number of program accreditations and international recognitions.  This year is our 33th graduation ceremony that will occur in June of 2018 when more than 1500 graduates will earn their degrees and go on to advanced studies or to excellent jobs in Europe, the region and the World.

In 1995 GAU started its expansion into the international higher education sector.  Since then educational partnerships have been developed in India, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, the USA, the UK, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong and Moldova.  These partnerships include student and faculty exchanges and the opportunity for students to experience different cultures and learning experiences.

The initial vision of the founders was to establish GAU as the pre-eminent institution of higher learning for the professions.  The university now includes degree offerings in Business and Economics, Politics, Health Sciences, Engineering, Communication, Humanities, Law, Pharmacy, Education, Architecture, Aviation, Marine, Nursing, Sports, Performing Arts and Tourism.

While heading towards the 50th year, GAU, throughout its 33 years of development the management, faculty and staff of the university have balanced the requirements for growth, with the need for high levels of quality, both in teaching and in the overall experience of each student.

Throughout its 33 year history, GAU has sought to optimize its use of the latest in technology and teaching methods.  While we have one of the highest Ph.D. to student ratios, we also have the highest computer to student ratio.  For the past five years the GAU library has been at the forefront of the revolution in library science; the implementation of digital library resources.  Many classes now include Power Point presentations and MP-4 download versions of the lectures.  The entire campus and all dormitories have Wi-Fi throughout.  GAU TV and Radio also broadcast selected lectures and seminars for student and faculty viewing.

GAU is continuing its global activities at an incredible pace today in light of its founding mission. As a member of the Universal Education Group and the American Education Consortium, GAU is moving firmly in achieving its targets while heading towards it’s 50th year in education.

Attention to all new students considering Cyprus Health and Social Sciences University: Several Moroccan students, including myself and over 10 of my friends, have been victims of a disturbing scam perpetrated by this institution.

Here's what happened: Upon transferring to Cyprus Health and Social Sciences University, we were promised the opportunity to continue our studies and build a better future. However, after paying hefty fees and transferring our hard-earned credits, the university shockingly forced us to start from scratch, nullifying all our previous efforts. Despite our protests, requests for refunds were callously denied.

Now, faced with this betrayal, we are left with a difficult decision to make. We can either allow ourselves to be victims of this injustice or take action to hold the university accountable and prevent others from falling into the same trap.

As a community, we must stand together and demand justice. We have the power to raise awareness, report misconduct, and seek restitution for ourselves and future students who may be targeted by similar scams.

To all new students: Before enrolling in any institution, please heed this warning and thoroughly research its reputation and practices. Your education and future are too precious to be jeopardized by deceitful institutions.

Together, let's ensure that no student falls victim to exploitation and injustice",e1ddcfb8a5cfd5f776f165f9,study-in-north-cyprus,3Kyv3hvrybf_YohTZRgPV,reviews,4d34c03297658aa360645336,unknown-field-4bd3f3f3
